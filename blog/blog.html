This art form is derived from an ancient Chinese horticultural practice, part of which was then redeveloped under the influence of Japanese Zen Buddhism.Techniques such as pinching buds, pruning and wiring branches, and carefully restricting but not abandoning fertilizers are used to limit and redirect healthy growth. Most commonly kept under four feet (or about a meter) in height, Bonsai are not genetically dwarfed plants. However, plants with smaller leaves do make these compositions easier to design.

But there is more to a bonsai plant. Bonsai plants benefit the owner or gardener’s psyche. Bonsai plants need a lot of care and time. You would learn to be loving and caring. You would also practice patience. Develop the traits of consistency, confidence, self-control and self-awareness. Explore your creative side as you style the bonsai plants to their spectacular look.Some other bonsai plant benefits are that they are good for the atmosphere in your home. If you have a bonsai tree indoors, it purifies the air inside your house by releasing oxygen. Having bonsai plants outdoors has similar benefits along with providing a green zone to de-stress or meditate in. A bonsai tree indoor can reduce the frequency of dry skin, sore throats and cold as they maintain the humidity in the atmosphere. They are great gifting options. Finally, need a lifelong friend? Grow a bonsai. Bonsai plants are known to have lived through generations making them family heirlooms as well.

                The major disadvantages of bonsai plants are that they require constant care and attention, need watering daily, can be expensive, and have been linked with increased insect infestations. Bonsai plants cannot be left for weeks on end by themselves when compared to other plant hobbies. Bonsais require a lot of work in other areas such as watering which needs to be done daily or even twice daily in some instances.
                Also, be prepared for a lot of trial and error when you get started with your first few designs not likely to look very good especially if you are learning bonsai by yourself – it’s not uncommon to spend hours trying to trim your first bonsai only for it to look like a Frankenstein version of the design you had in your head. 
                On top of this, the journey is never complete and your bonsai will never be at a stage where you will be happy with it – part of the charm is that your project will never be finished so be prepared to invest a lot of time and hours in your new-found hobby – which is definitely concerning if you don’t have a lot of free time!

                Stress appears to be increasingly present in our modern and demanding industrialized society. Every aspect of our bodies and brains can be virtually influenced by stress induced by living in an urban environment . Early human civilizations lived in natural settings, demonstrating that we can adapt to nature. Congruent with this viewpoint, individuals living in modern societies who are experiencing stress have become interested in several types of natural therapy . For example, psychological evaluations of the effects of horticultural therapy on the elderly have been previously reported.The progress and development of research involving nature and forest medicine has advanced in recent years with the development of medical equipment related to the natural and life sciences. For example, oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentrations in the prefrontal cortex were measured using a portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device, which revealed that foliage plants can have physiological relaxation effects in male participants

                Research demonstrates that oxygen consumption, regional cerebral blood response, and oxy-Hb supply are increased in highly activated neural regions [18]. A lower oxy-Hb concentration indicates that the quantity of oxygen transmitted to the prefrontal cortex tissue is small. The lower prefrontal cortex activity found in the current study is consistent with that reported in previous studies , showing that low oxy-Hb concentrations represent the calming of brain activity. For example, in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hemispheric specialization of emotional processing has been proposed by functional magnetic resonance imagining. In particular, the activation of the left prefrontal cortex has been associated with positive mood and the processing of positive stimuli, whereas the activation of the right prefrontal cortex has been linked to negative mood and the processing of negative stimuli.

                In conclusion, the current study revealed that visual stimulation with bonsai trees in adult male patients with SCI elicited the following: (1) significantly suppressed left prefrontal cortex activity; (2) significantly increased parasympathetic nervous activity and decreased sympathetic nervous activity; (3) significantly increased “comfortable,” “relaxed,” and “natural” feelings as assessed using the modified SD method; and (4) significantly decreased negative and increased positive POMS subscale scores. The findings of this study can be applied to SCI patients by taking advantage of their natural surroundings to ensure improved health and reduced mental stress. Generally, considerably less practice is supported by research, and the reality is that little research is applied in practice. We can say that this study is useful because in practice the effects are proved by research data.
